This Refund Policy explains our guidelines and procedures regarding refunds for services and transactions made through the Sriverse cross-platform app ("App"). Please read this policy carefully before initiating any transactions or making any payments within the App.

<br /> 1. Refund Eligibility:
Wallet-to-Wallet Transfers: Once a wallet-to-wallet transfer is initiated and completed, it is irreversible. We cannot refund or reverse the transfer.
Wallet-to-Third-Party App Transfers: The refund policy for wallet-to-third-party app transfers depends on the policies of the respective third-party app or service. You are advised to refer to their terms and conditions or contact their customer support for refund inquiries.
Services: Refunds for services such as recharge, ticket booking, shopping, etc., are subject to the terms and conditions of the specific service provider. Please review their refund policies or contact their customer support for more information.
Disputed Transactions:
If you believe that a transaction made through the App was unauthorized or there was an error, please contact our customer support immediately. We will investigate the matter and take appropriate actions to resolve the issue promptly.

<br /> 2. Unauthorized Transactions:
If you suspect any unauthorized activity on your Sriverse account or if your account credentials have been compromised, please notify us immediately. We will take necessary measures to secure your account and investigate the unauthorized transaction(s) in accordance with our security procedures.

<br /> 3. Process for Refunds:
If a refund is applicable based on the terms and conditions mentioned above, the process for obtaining a refund may vary depending on the nature of the transaction and the involved parties. Please follow the instructions provided by the respective service provider or contact their customer support for refund requests.

<br /> 4. Refund Timeframe:
The timeframe for processing refunds may vary depending on factors such as the payment method used, the specific service provider's refund policy, and any applicable regulations. We will make reasonable efforts to process refunds in a timely manner. However, please note that the actual time it takes for the refunded amount to reflect in your account may depend on external factors beyond our control.

<br />Contact Us:
If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Refund Policy or need assistance with a refund request, please contact our customer support at support@kisssanbillpay.com. Our team will be happy to assist you and provide further guidance.
